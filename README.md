## Comparison of Machine Learning Classifiers on spatially weighted ASTER spectral features to classify tree types

Remotely-sensed, geographically weighted data for a tract of forested land was created
from ASTER imagery by B. Johnson et al to classify the pixels into one of four land
covers. The study used a support vector machine with a radial basis kernel to classify the
pixels and achieved a test accuracy of 85.9%. The purpose of this document is to
examine additional statistical learning methods for classifying this dataset with the
intention improving the generalized performance of the originating study.
